#Covid-19 Risk)

#Problem :

#Task : Estimating the risk of death from coronavirus.

#Consider the following questions in terms of True/False regarding anyone else.

#Are you a cigarette addict older than 75 years old? Variable → age

#Do you have a severe chronic disease? Variable → chronic

#Is your immune system too weak? Variable → immune

#Set a logical algorithm using boolean logic operators (and/or) and the given variables in order to give 
#us True (there is a risk of death) or False (there is not a risk of death) as a result.


#age =  # can be assigned only True/False
#chronic =  # can be assigned only True/False
#immune =  # can be assigned only True/False
#risk = ? (True or False)


#Are you a cigarette addict older than 75 years old?

üst_age = True
alt_age = False

#Do you have a severe chronic disease?

chronic_yes = True
chronic_no = False

#Is your immune system too weak?

immune_yes = True
immune_no = False

risk = (üst_age or alt_age) and (chronic_yes or chronic_no) and \
(immune_yes or immune_no)
risk
