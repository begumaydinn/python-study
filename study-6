#Profit Calculation

#Task - 1 :
#You work for a manufacturer as a programmer and have been asked to calculate the total profit made on the sales of a product. 
#You are given a dictionary (sales) containing the cost price per unit (in dollars), sell price per unit (in dollars), and the beginning inventory. 
#Write a program to return the total profit made, rounded to the nearest dollar. Assume all of the inventory has been sold. 
#The name and the keys of the dictionary are constant, so use them as they are.
#The example of the values (sell-cost value, inventory) and total profit :

sales = {
  "cost_value": 31.87,
  "sell_value": 45.00,
  "inventory": 1000
}  

# the profit will be : 13130

#İNPUT
sales = {
"cost_value": 31.87,
"sell_value": 45.00,
"inventory": 1000
}
print(int((sales["sell_value"]-sales["cost_value"]) * sales["inventory"]))


#Task - 2 :
#Your boss wants you to prepare the payrolls of the workers in your department. 
#You have to convert the amount of dollars into payroll format. In order to help move things along, 
#you have volunteered to write a code that will take a float and return the money in the following format (as dollars and cents). 

#İNPUT

payroll = float(input("Please enter your salary : $"))
payroll = round(payroll, 2)
print('$', payroll)
