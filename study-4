#Task:

#Find out if a given year is a "leap" year.

#In the Gregorian calendar, three criteria must be taken into account to identify leap years:
#The year must be evenly divisible by 4;
#If the year can also be evenly divided by 100, it is not a leap year; unless...
#The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
#According to these rules, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, and 2500 are not the leap years.
#Write a Python program that;
#Takes a 4-digit year from the user,
#Prints True if the given year by the user is a leap year, prints False otherwise.


#input

year = int(input("Write a four digit year :"))

leap_year = (year%4==0 and year%100==0) or year%400==0
print(leap_year)
